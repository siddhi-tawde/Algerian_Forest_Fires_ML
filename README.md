Algerian Forest Fires Prediction

Project Overview

This project aims to predict the occurrence and severity of forest fires in Algeria based on various environmental attributes. The dataset used is the Algerian Forest Fires Dataset, which contains meteorological and fire-related data collected from two regions: Bejaia (northeast Algeria) and Sidi Bel-abbes (northwest Algeria).

Dataset Information

The dataset consists of 244 instances, with 122 instances for each region. Data was recorded between June 2012 and September 2012. The dataset includes 11 attributes and 1 output attribute (class). The instances are classified into Fire (138 instances) and Not Fire (106 instances) categories.

Attribute Information

Date: (DD/MM/YYYY) - Day, Month ('June' to 'September'), Year (2012).

Temp: Maximum temperature at noon in Celsius (22 to 42Â°C).

RH: Relative Humidity (%) (21 to 90).

Ws: Wind speed in km/h (6 to 29).

Rain: Total rainfall for the day in mm (0 to 16.8).

FFMC: Fine Fuel Moisture Code index (28.6 to 92.5).

DMC: Duff Moisture Code index (1.1 to 65.9).

DC: Drought Code index (7 to 220.4).

ISI: Initial Spread Index (0 to 18.5).

BUI: Buildup Index (1.1 to 68).

FWI: Fire Weather Index (0 to 31.1).

Class: Binary classification - Fire or Not Fire.

Workflow

The project follows a structured machine learning pipeline:

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Handled missing values and inconsistent data entries.

Standardized and formatted the dataset for better analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualized data distributions and relationships between features.

Identified important features influencing fire occurrences.

Model Training & Evaluation

Tested multiple regression models: Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, and ElasticNet.

Selected Ridge Regression as the final model based on the lowest cost function.

Model Serialization

Saved the trained Ridge Regression model using the pickle library for future use.

Web Application Deployment

Developed an interactive web application using Flask.

Integrated the trained model into the web app for real-time fire prediction based on user inputs.

Deployed the web application on AWS for public accessibility.

Features

Predicts forest fire occurrence based on environmental attributes.

Uses Ridge Regression for optimal performance.

Interactive web application built with Flask.

Deployed on AWS, making it accessible from anywhere.

User-friendly interface to input weather conditions and receive predictions.

Fast and accurate predictions based on trained machine learning models.
